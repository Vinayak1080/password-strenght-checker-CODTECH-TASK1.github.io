Project Overview: Password Strength Checker
Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a tool that evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords. By providing real-time feedback on password strength, the tool helps users create secure passwords, enhancing their overall online security.

Key Features:

Password Analysis:

Length: Assesses whether the password meets minimum length requirements.
Complexity: Evaluates the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Uniqueness: Detects commonly used or predictable patterns, such as dictionary words or sequences.
Strength Metrics:

Provides a clear visual or textual representation of the password's strength (e.g., weak, moderate, strong).
Offers actionable suggestions for improvement.
User-Friendly Design:

Intuitive interface for users to test their passwords quickly.
Instant feedback system for better user engagement.
Technologies Used:

Frontend: To create an interactive interface for users (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Backend (optional): For advanced password checks or real-time validation (e.g., Python, Node.js).
Algorithms: Custom logic or libraries to evaluate password patterns and enforce security best practices.
Applications:

Personal use to improve individual password habits.
Integration into websites or applications for secure user account creation.
Educational tool for teaching the importance of password security.
Outcome:
A secure and intuitive tool that empowers users to create strong passwords, safeguarding their digital identities in an increasingly cyber-threatened world.
